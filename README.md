## About

This is a quick project to learn more about the use of containers and `docker-compose.yml`. This project has a quick setup for TDD with unit tests and a brief API to manual connection tests.

### Built with

- [x] Node.js
- [x] Docker
- [x] `docker-compose`
- [x] `express`

## What I learned

- Implement Docker at development environment;
- Use `docker-compose` to run tests;
- Implement a quick RESTful API using containers;
- Know more about some tags of `.yml` file.

## Getting started
